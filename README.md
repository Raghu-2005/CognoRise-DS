IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
This repository contains code and data for a data science project to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. The project uses the Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset in machine learning.

The project follows the following steps to classify Iris flowers using data science:

1.Data preprocessing: The data is cleaned and prepared for modeling by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
2.Exploratory data analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to understand the data and identify patterns and relationships between the features.
3.Feature engineering: New features are created or existing features are transformed to improve the performance of the machine learning models.
4.Model training and evaluation: A variety of machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated on a held-out test set to select the best model.
5.Model deployment: The best model is deployed to production so that it can be used to predict the species of new Iris flowers.

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

1.NumPy
2.SciPy
3.Pandas
4.Matplotlib
5.Scikit-learn

REQUIREMENTS
To run this project, you will need the following:

1.Python 3
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.The Python libraries listed above

CONCLUSION
This project demonstrates how to use data science to classify Iris flowers. The project covers all the steps involved in a data science project, from data preprocessing to model deployment. The decision tree algorithm achieved the highest accuracy on the held-out test set, with an accuracy of 98.33%.
